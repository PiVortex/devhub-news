This week, we bring you a roundup of updates designed to enhance your development experience with NEAR. From stateless validation to Ethereum alignment, let's dive in!




&nbsp;


### News


1. **Alex Shevchenko (Aurora Labs CEO) shares plans for Ethereum Alignment:**
Alex Shevchenko joined Joe Spano on DevHub live to share plans that will enable users to interact with NEAR whilst retaining an EVM user experience. This will allow one to use tools like Metamask to interact with NEAR. This comes from a [proposal](https://github.com/near/NEPs/issues/518) shared back in November last year. üëâ [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vGbHJhwGSk&t=2540s)


2. **Approval of NEP-509, Stateless validation stage 0:**
The Protocol Workgroup has officially approved NEP-509 to achieve phase 2 of sharding with stateless validation. üëâ [LINK](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/509/files#diff-6a0303f0a0bbbb5536acb0f78d7a7d7c446194c39ba9c0d7cbb8e0c9a52a345a)


3. **near.org outage postmortem:**
Pagoda published a blog following the near.org / RPC outage last week üëâ [LINK](https://docs.near.org/blog/2024-07-11-near-org-outage)


4. **Chain Signatures audit report:**
Pagoda received the audit report for Chain Signatures. One of the recommendations was to switch the key derivation function from sha2 hash to sha3 hash. This is a breaking change so applications will need to update their client libraries. üëâ [LINK](https://t.me/chain_abstraction/1709)


5. **Race of Slothes adds new projects:**
Aurora, MyNearWallet, and FastNEAR have joined the race! From now you can contribute to these awesome projects and get Sloth Points just by tagging the bot in pull requests. üëâ [LINK](https://race-of-sloths.com/)


6. **Race of Slothes launches first contest:**
The first Race of Slothes contest has begun! Three tickets for the Ukrainian Rust Conference 2024 are being given away as prizes to the winners. üëâ [LINK](https://x.com/race_of_sloths/status/1813282289817624826)


7. **DevHub launches new technical livestream, WuASM:**
DevHub has launched a new mobile-optimized show focused on building and entrepreneurship. This week we had [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgb_oxDV9Bc&t=800s) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdEaniVOvR4&t=565s) on App Architecture. Episodes are livestreamed on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@NEARDevHub), [Twitter](https://x.com/neardevhub) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/neardevhub) at 11AM UTC a few days a week.  


8. **Rainbow Bridge defends against invalid block:**
The Rainbow Bridge - which enables bridging between Ethereum mainnet, NEAR, and Aurora - has successfully defended against an attack to submit an invalid block causing the attacker to lose 5 ETH. üëâ [LINK](https://x.com/BowenWang18/status/1812290216662835456)


9. **Hackers win NEAR bounties with AI tools @ ETHCC:**
The ETHCC hackathon delivered two interesting AI projects. One of the winners was a tool that explains transactions in a digestible manner üëâ [LINK](https://github.com/mohamedalichelbi/ethbrussels24) and the other winner was an agent used to perform actions on NEAR such as minting and sending NFTs from a user's prompt. üëâ [LINK](https://github.com/RezaRahemtola/near-ai-assistant)


10. **Browser NEAR API tool:**
Community member Volodymyr shared a tool to interact with NEAR from the browser created by himself and his brother. üëâ [App](https://lantstool.io/) üëâ [GitHub](https://github.com/lantstools/ui.web.lantstool)


11. **Using chain signatures to call other NEAR accounts:**
There was a long discussion about using chain signatures to call other NEAR accounts to enable streamlined implementations of social login and recovery, cheaper multisig, and more. üëâ [LINK](https://t.me/chain_abstraction/1653)


12. **Should NEAR have free unlimited rate RPC endpoints:**
FastNEAR wrote a great tweet about how they don't believe there should exist free RPCs provided to large clients. üëâ [LINK](https://x.com/fast_near/status/1813004796271460404)


13. **Smallest NEAR contract:**
An account with a proxy contract deployed for less than 0.02 NEAR! This is what the FastNEAR team cooked up on Friday. Vlad Frolov also shared a contract, that uses the [nesdie SDK](https://github.com/austinabell/nesdie), that transfers NEAR that compiles to just 916 bytes. Can you create a smaller contract? üëâ [LINK](https://x.com/fast_near/status/1814446732450689324)


### In case you missed it 

**Nightshade 2.0 testnet release:** 
Has been officially released on testnet, marking a significant step forward for NEAR Protocol. This update introduces stateless validation, paving the way for scalability across multiple shards and enhanced performance within a single shard. Kudos to the team for their hard work in delivering this milestone! Learn more about Nightshade 2.0 [here](https://t.co/MnnzEYI8dA).
