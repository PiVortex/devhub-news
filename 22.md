**Welcome to the latest edition of NEAR Dev NEWS!**

It's edition #22 and we've got your developer updates. Updates include a new chain signatures interface, a new wallet selector release, and more. To get NEAR Dev News first each week [SUBSCRIBE](https://newsletter.neardevhub.org/) to our mailing list. Let's dive in!

# News

1. **New Chain Signatures Interface** 
There is a [new interface](https://github.com/near/mpc/blob/develop/chain-signatures/README.md) for producing chain signatures. Note that the key derivation function has also switched from sha2 to sha3, check out this [working example](https://github.com/Mintbase/near-ca/blob/8d445fa3ac46b207fdef0ae29d17a8d1182cdd3e/src/utils/kdf.ts#L9-L23). This is part of the [1.0.0-rc.1 release](https://github.com/near/mpc/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc.1). Currently, to get signatures you should use `v1.signer-dev.testnet`. Once stable this will be deployed to `v2.multichain-mpc.testnet` in the coming days. `v5.multichain-mpc-dev.testnet` will host the most recent commits (not stable).


2. **New Wallet Selector Release:**
