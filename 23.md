5. **Converting Ponky2 proof to Groth16 and verifying on NEAR**
Community member Artur shared a POC he was working on to create a plonky proof, verifying the proof in a Groth16 circuit to generate a Groth16 proof and then verifying the Groth16 proof in a NEAR smart contract. If you're building or looking to build with ZK on NEAR this may be useful üëâ [LINK](https://github.com/akorchyn/near-zk-reputation-poc)

Also, Wake Up and Ship More had an episode diving into [creating flow charts and their use when building MVPs and production apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4EwOMYkEWU&t=750s) and another episode where [AI questions Joe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLSJeZ5KezY&t=650s).

### In case you missed it


- **New Chain Signatures Interface**
There is a [new interface](https://github.com/near/mpc/blob/develop/chain-signatures/README.md) for producing chain signatures. Note that the key derivation function has also switched from sha2 to sha3. check out this [working example for Ethereum](https://github.com/near-examples/near-multichain). Currently, to get signatures you should use `v1.signer-dev.testnet`. Once stable this will be deployed to `v2.multichain-mpc.testnet`. `v5.multichain-mpc-dev.testnet` will host the most recent commits (not stable).


- **New Wallet Selector Release:**
The NEAR Wallet Selector has just had a new release that includes support for Ethereum wallets, as mentioned last week. Check out all the updates in the release notes üëâ [LINK](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/releases/tag/v8.9.11)


- **Decentralized Indexer Network:**
NEAT has partnered with The Graph to build a Decentralized Indexer Network for AI on NEAR üëâ [LINK](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/neat-partners-with-the-graph-to-build-decentralized-indexer-network-for-ai-on-near-1b0b9f2d469b)


- **Yield / Resume examples:** Guillermo has created a repo containing two examples that show how to use the new yield/resume functionality. üëâ [LINK](https://github.com/gagdiez/yield-resume/tree/main)
